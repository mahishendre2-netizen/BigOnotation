# BigOnotation
# Aim
To learn about code analysis on Big O'notation.

# Theory
Big O notation describes an algorithm's efficiency and performance as the input size grows by providing an upper bound on its worst-case time or space complexity. It helps compare algorithms and predict their scalability by focusing on the growth rate, using algebraic terms to ignore constants and less significant terms, such as O(1) for constant time or O(n) for linear time.

Focus on the dominant term: When an algorithm's operations are expressed as an equation (e.g., n² + n + 1), Big O focuses on the most significant term as input size grows, discarding constants and lower-order terms. # #  # # Examples of common Big O notations:

O(1) Constant Time: The time taken is constant, regardless of the input size.

O(n) Linear Time: The time taken grows linearly with the input size.

O(n²) Quadratic Time: The time taken grows with the square of the input size.

# What it Big O'notation
-Mathematical notation: It uses symbols like O(f(n)) to classify the performance of an algorithm.

-Growth rate: It measures how an algorithm's runtime or memory usage scales with the input size (n).

-Worst-case scenario: Big O typically describes the worst-case complexity, meaning it's an upper bound on the performance.

# Why is Big O'notation needed
-Algorithm comparison: It allows developers to compare the efficiency of different algorithms and choose the most suitable one for a given problem.

-Scalability: It helps predict how an algorithm will perform when the input size increases significantly, indicating its scalability.

-Code optimization: Understanding Big O enables developers to write better-performing and more efficient code.

# Conclusion
Big O notation provides a way to talk about the relative efficiency of algorithms, letting us know whether an algorithm will eventually scale better than another for larger inputs, even if the exact speed in seconds or milliseconds is not given
